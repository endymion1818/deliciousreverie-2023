A links page?! This is a bit old school, isn't it?

I don't believe it is. I've seen the world wide web morph from AOL and eWorld to Angelfire and Geocites, to a massive conglomeration of independent city-states, to the control of the Megacorporations of today. I fear the loss of the World Wide Web as Sir Tim saw it:â€” a vast store of interconnected knowledge.
