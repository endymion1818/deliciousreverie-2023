---
Hi, I'm Ben, an experienced Senior Software Engineer, who has spent most of my career focused on frontend technologies like React, Svelte and Vue, and writing isomorphic JavaScript code for both GraphQL and REST APIs. I have also enjoyed success as a hands-on DevRel, which saw an increase of 140% month-on-month of website sessions, and a 24% growth in organic traffic. More details below.

## Developer Relations Successes:

### Evangelising Products:

I utilise social media listening tools to follow relevant terms and competitors and increase brand awareness to new audiences 

I engage in relevant discussions on social media such as Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn and others to promote more brand awareness, respond to questions and defend the brand and product

I schedule and produce daily Tweets and LinkedIn messages, writing copy and designing artwork, researching hashtags and trending topics which led to a 140% increase in traffic from social media over 1 month

### Driving Community Engagement

With my colleague I have experience of managing a community of over 1,500 developers who were actively using the product, supported their learning journey and involved them in company decisions (where possible) so they felt a sense of ownership, involvement and community

### Building A Community Writer Program

I managed a community writer team of over 40 writers worldwide, assessing their suitability to take on articles, onboard them to the program, reviewing their submissions (including code), and formatting their articles for publications
The technical writer program led to a 24% growth in organic traffic and a page 2 ranking on google for a key search term

### Writing, Documentation and More

Build integrations with related products (eg Next.JS, Svelte, Astro, Gatsby) to help onboard users more quickly
Writing, updating and maintaining documentation portal
Building new landing pages and page sections in line with marketing strategies.

### Want to work together?

That would be great. I love working with small teams who have a fascinating product idea that you'd like to get off the ground, especially if it's in the open source space. You can book a slot in my calendar by visiting my contact page. It'll be great to talk to you.

## Software Engineering Successes:

### Strategy and Planning

Tech lead for my team which involved reporting to senior management and colleagues, writing documentation, test cases etc.

I also identified an opportunity to drastically reduce operating costs by replatforming to a much more cost effective service, and investigated strategies to do so

Chair & Co-chair of the Frontend Guild, involved in guild strategy, direction and organisation

### Mentoring and Training

As Senior Engineer, helped other junior & mid-level engineers to learn debugging methods and React APIs to help them deliver their work

### Engineering

Lead developer on a chat application, utilizing a new GraphQL API, which also involved building new UI elements, caching queries and sequential loading (as the GraphQL team had not yet built subscriptions due to complications from underlying APIs)
Over a 10 month period, rebuilt a React application (Gatsby) from the ground up to be from JavaScript to TypeScript, with 60-70% test coverage, both unit and end-to-end, and utilize internal react components, and integrated it with several APIs

## Can I help you to deliver?

I love working in engineering teams that have a clear organizational structure and roadmap. I also like working in environments that have a healthy work-life balance and have a standard holiday package. I do not work for companies in gambling, military or adult entertainment  sectors or blockchain related markets.

You can book a slot in my calendar by visiting my contact page. I look forward to discussing your requirements.
