I made a collection of loading states for Tailwind. It was relatively easy exercise, and I'm surprised I didn't find anything like it out there already.

You might recognise the first element from the [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/animation#pulse), which demonstrates how to use the `animate-pulse` class to make it look like it's in the process of loading in.

Here's the CodePen:

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="eYbPBjE" data-user="endymion1818" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

Feel free to copy or remix this pen, I'm not precious about it and just wanted a collection I could reference for some other work I was doing.
