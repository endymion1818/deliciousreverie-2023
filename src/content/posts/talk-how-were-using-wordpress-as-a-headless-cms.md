I'm not a stranger to public speaking. But speaking on a technical subject? To people who are smarter than me? Not something I relish. Yet, I felt I had something to offer the WordPress community, so I volunteered to speak at one of the UK's biggest WordPress meetups, WordCamp London.

UPDATE: Here's the talk hosted on [Wordpress.tv](http://wordpress.tv/)

Ever since starting my web development career I've wanted to be in the place where I could help other developers out with their development dilemmas. It's taken me a long time to get to this stage, and it's only because of some great help from the following people:

-   Chris Geary
-   David Hewitt
-   Steve Woodall
-   Louise Towler

It's thanks to them imparting their knowledge and expertise (and sometimes their time), as well as others, that I have anything that might be considered worthy of sharing.

## The Talk [#](https://deliciousreverie.co.uk/posts/talk-how-were-using-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms/#the-talk)

My talk covered these main points:

1.  What is a headless (or decoupled) CMS
2.  Why use WordPress as a headless CMS
3.  Tools and process of building a headless site
4.  A basic example and some gotchas we found
5.  The Future is (probably) headless

[You can find it on the conference website too.](https://2018.london.wordcamp.org/session/how-were-using-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms/)

## The experience [#](https://deliciousreverie.co.uk/posts/talk-how-were-using-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms/#the-experience)

... was terrifying, to say the least! I rattled through it all in less than 30 mins (I had been given 35 minutes), but there were some really great comments & questions from the audience that I found fascinating. I'm currently planning a series of blog posts on some of the questions that were raised."
